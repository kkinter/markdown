In this course we use `async` in front of all our our functions:
Example: `async def this_is_a_function():`  
-   We use `async` in FastAPI, due to asynchronous code, concurrency, and parallelism.
-   Using `async` is not necessary when coding with FastAPI, however during this course I am being explicit with saying `async` before each function.

Therefore you may use `def this_is_a_function():`  instead.
In any of the cases above, FastAPI will still work asynchronously and perform very fast.
Using `async` before the function, typically provides performance optimizations when handling asynchronous functions.
